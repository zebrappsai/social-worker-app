## 11. Proof of Concept (POC) Requirements

### 11.1 POC Scope
- Demonstration of core functionality flow:
  * Voice recording or audio file upload
  * Speech-to-text conversion
  * Basic text processing and report generation
  * Simple report preview and editing
  * Basic language switching (Hebrew/Arabic UI)

### 11.2 POC Technical Implementation
- Web-based implementation for easy sharing and testing
- Use of open-source and free-tier services:
  * Browser's built-in WebAudio API for recording
  * Web Speech API for basic speech recognition
  * Local storage for saving recordings and drafts
  * Browser-based text processing
  * Client-side language detection
- No backend requirements - fully client-side implementation
- No cloud service dependencies
- No database requirements - file-based storage

### 11.3 POC Features
- Recording Functionality:
  * Maximum 5-minute recording length for POC phase
  * Basic audio visualizer
  * Play/Pause/Stop controls
  * Recording timer display
  * Audio file upload option
- Text Processing:
  * Basic text extraction from audio
  * Simple formatting of unstructured text
  * Basic template application
  * Manual editing capabilities
- Language Support:
  * Basic Hebrew and Arabic UI elements
  * Language toggle functionality
  * Simple right-to-left (RTL) support
- Report Generation:
  * Basic report template
  * Simple text formatting
  * Preview capability
  * Download as text file

### 11.4 POC Limitations
- Limited offline functionality
- Basic speech recognition accuracy
- Simple text processing without AI enhancement
- Limited template options
